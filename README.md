Rust binding for macOS Keychain Services, including TouchID-guarded access to
cryptographic keys stored in the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP).

This binding aims to provide a thin wrapper using largely the same type names
as Keychain Services itself, but also provide a safe, mostly idiomatic API
which does not rely on e.g. Core Foundation types.

**NOTE:** This is an unofficial binding which is in no way affiliated with Apple!

## Status

This crate is **experimental** and may have bugs/memory safety issues.
*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

Below is a rough outline of the Keychain Service API and what is supported
by this crate:

- [ ] Keychains (`SecKeychain`)
  - [x] Creating keychains
  - [x] Deleting keychains
  - [ ] Open keychain (`SecKeychainOpen`)
  - [ ] Keychain status (`SecKeychainGetStatus`)
  - [ ] Keychain version (`SecKeychainGetVersion`)
  - [ ] Set default keychain (`SecKeychainSetDefault`)
- [ ] Keychain Items (`SecKeychainItem`)
  - [x] Creating keychain items
  - [x] Fetching keychain items
  - [x] Getting keychain item attributes
  - [ ] Deleting keychain items
- [ ] Certificates / Identities (`SecCertificate`)
  - [ ] Creating certificates
  - [ ] Deleting certificates
  - [ ] Querying certificates
  - [ ] Signing certificates
- [x] Cryptographic keys (`SecKey`)
  - [x] Generating cryptographic keys
  - [x] Importing cryptographic keys
  - [x] Exporting cryptographic keys
  - [x] Deleting cryptographic keys
  - [x] Querying cryptographic keys
  - [x] Querying cryptographic key attributes
  - [x] Digital signatures (ECDSA/RSA)
  - [x] Encryption
- [x] Passwords
  - [x] Creating passwords
  - [x] Querying passwords
  - [ ] Deleting passwords

## Tests

This crate has two suites of tests:

- Core: `cargo test` - run a minimal set of tests (e.g. in CI) that work
  everywhere, but don't cover all functionality.
- Interactive: `cargo test --features=interactive-tests --no-run`
  compile tests which require user interactions, and additionally must be
  signed by macOS's code signing in order to work. See code signing notes.

## Code Signing

The Keychain Service API requires signed code to access much of its
functionality. Accessing many APIs from an unsigned app will return
an `ErrorKind::MissingEntitlement`.

Follow the instructions here to create a self-signed code signing certificate:
<https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html>

You will need to use the [codesign] command-line utility (or XCode) to sign
your code before it will be able to access most Keychain Services API
functionality.
